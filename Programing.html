        <h1> Programing </h1>
            <p>
            Below is some of the programing work that I have bone will in IST. Programing is providing 
            a computer or other machine with coded instructions for the automatic performance of a particular task.

        <h1> This website </h1>
        <p>
            The website that you are looking was all done in code. I have made this with help from some websites like 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools.com</a>. This website has loads of references and examples
            of how to insert pictures videos and links. the link above was inserted using help from there website. The
            picture is the code for this page.

        <h1> Omnifood </h1>
        <p>
            This is a website that we all had to make. this was to learn how to code. This page is actually the back
            bone to this website. This was setup with instruction from videos that were made to teach HTML. Much
            of what I learned from the lessons that made this website. the picture is the front page in code and 
            what I look like in a web page.
